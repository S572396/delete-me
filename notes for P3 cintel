# Additional Python Notes
# ------------------------

# Capitalization matters in Python. Python is case-sensitive: min and Min are different.
# Spelling matters in Python. You must match the spelling of functions and variables exactly.
# Indentation matters in Python. Indentation is used to define code blocks and must be consistent.

# Functions
# ---------
# Functions are used to group code together and make it more readable and reusable.
# We define custom functions that can be called later in the code.
# Functions are blocks of logic that can take inputs, perform work, and return outputs.

# Defining Functions
# ------------------
# Define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses, and a colon. 
# The function name should describe what the function does.
# In the parentheses, specify the inputs needed as arguments the function takes.

# For example:
#    The function filtered_data() takes no arguments.
#    The function between(min, max) takes two arguments, a minimum and maximum value.
#    Arguments can be positional or keyword arguments, labeled with a parameter name.

# The function body is indented (consistently!) after the colon. 
# Use the return keyword to return a value from a function.

# Calling Functions
# -----------------
# Call a function by using its name followed by parentheses and any required arguments.
    
# Decorators
# ----------
# Use the @ symbol to decorate a function with a decorator.
# Decorators a concise way of calling a function on a function.
# We don't typically write decorators, but we often use them.


# --------------------------------------------------------
# Reactive calculations and effects
# --------------------------------------------------------

# Add a reactive calculation to filter the data
# By decorating the function with @reactive, we can use the function to filter the data
# The function will be called whenever an input functions used to generate that output changes.
# Any output that depends on the reactive function (e.g., filtered_data()) will be updated when the data changes.

@reactive.calc
def filtered_data():
    isSpeciesMatch = penguins_df["species"].isin(input.selected_species_list())
    return penguins_df[isSpeciesMatch]
